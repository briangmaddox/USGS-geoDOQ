		       doq2geotiff Users Manual

   This document describes the program doq2geotiff.  This program will convert
a DOQ that meets the 12/96 keyword-based header standard and convert it to a
GeoTIFF which is very similar to a USGS DRG file.  The resulting GeoTIFF
images can be viewed in most standard TIFF viewers or in GIS software (such as
ArcView 3, Imagine, ect).   Currently, the software can handle BIP and Grey
image data, but not BIL or BSQ formats.  These formats are slated for a future
release.

  The program is run with the following syntax:

   doq2geotiff [option] [doq-file geotiff-file]

where the command line options are:

-V  display the version of the executable
-p  use the primary datum information to store into the GeoTIFF (default)
-s  use the secondary datum information to store into the GeoTIFF
-t  generates an ARC world file whose name will be geotiff-file.tfw
-h  outputs an ASCII header file containing the metadata (geotiff-file.hdr)

   If called with the -p argument, the program uses the primary datum 
information to populate the GeoTIFF header.  This information is pulled
from the following DOQ keywords:
	HORIZONTAL_DATUM
	XY_ORIGIN
	HORIZONTAL_RESOLUTION
	COORDINATE_ZONE
   For -s, the SECONDARY_HORIZONTAL_DATUM and SECONDARY_XY_ORIGIN DOQ keywords
are used.

Here are a few examples:
barney:/disk1/geotiff1>./doq2geotiff -V
./doq2geotiff: $Revision: 1.1.1.1 $

barney:/disk1/geotiff1>./doq2geotiff -s C2508038.NWS C2508038.tiff

and so on

   If the program cannot find a valid HORIZONTAL_DATUM DOQ keyword, it will
assume the datum of NAD83.  Note that if it cannot find a suitable datum, the
georeferencing information will be invalid.

   For a listing of all keywords from the 12/96 DOQ header which are used in
the creation of the GeoTIFF, as well as additional information, please consult
the file format.txt which is also in this distribution.
