   This is the USGS doq2geotiff program.  It takes keyword format USGS
Digital Orthophoto's and converts them into GeoTIFF format.  The usage of the
program can be found by running it as "doq2geotiff -?" without the quotes.

Here are some of the "problems" which have come up with adding SPCS to 
doq2geotiff.

1) Louisiana Offshore isn't supported by GeoTIFF.  Currently, the conversion 
   software will output an error message if it encounters it.  It is not
   currently known how many quads this will affect.  Work is being done to see
   if it maps closely enough to one of the other Louisiana SP zones.

2) International Feet aren't support by GeoTIFF.  It is encoded as a user
   defined linear unit.  Some viewers here at MCMC had problems loading
   GeoTIFFs with this setting.  In some cases, they crashed fairly badly
   so the user may wish to beware if they try this.

3) Many (if not all) of the GIS packages here ignore the linear unit measure
   and assume meters.  This has had the observed effect of right number, wrong
   unit, to crashing the GIS.


   Note that this directory also houses some other utilities which work on
DOQ's.  Some of these utilities may or may not be in a state where they compile
as they may not be have been converted to use the new Image library yet.  If 
not, you may have to do the porting yourself or see if I have a newer version.

   As per the MPL, there is no warranty or support offered with any of the
utilities distributed here.  This is especially true with versions of this
software compiled on a Win32 system.  There is no guarantee that this software
will not crash horribly, so it's probably a good idea to not base your entire
business plan on using this software.  The terms and conditions of the MPL
also cover any use of this source in commercial software packages.  See LICENSE
