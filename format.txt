			Format of the GeoTIFF


   This document describes the keys from the 12/96 DOQ standard which are 
used to populate the GeoTIFF header, as well as the keys in the GeoTIFF and
TIFF standards.  For more information, please consult the following URL's:

   GeoTIFF standard: http://mcmcweb.er.usgs.gov/drg/geotiff.html
   TIFF Standard:    http://mcmcweb.er.usgs.gov/drg/tiff_60.pdf (Acrobat)
   DRG Standard:     http://mcmcweb.er.usgs.gov/drg/drg_std.html
   Note:  The DRG standard provides a detailed description of a NMD GeoTIFF
          product


Tagged Information:
   ModelTiepointTag (GeoTIFF) - UTM coordinates of the upper left corner
      obtained from the XY_ORIGIN key
   ModelPixelScaleTag (GeoTIFF) - Pixel scale for referencing
      obtained from the HORIZONTAL_RESOLUTION tag

Keyed Information:
   GTModelTypeGeoKey (GeoTIFF), GTRasterTypeGeoKey, ProjectedCSTypeGeoKey,
     and PCSCitationGeoKey - these keys are used for georeferencing information
     and hold items such as the coordinate zone, ect.  They come from the 
     following DOQ keywords:
       HORIZONTAL_DATUM (or SECONDARY_HORIZONTAL_DATUM)
       XY_ORIGIN
       HORIZONTAL_RESOLUTION
       COORDINATE_ZONE

   TIFFTAG_IMAGEWIDTH (TIFF) - SAMPLES_AND_LINES
   TIFFTAG_IMAGELENGTH (TIFF) - SAMPLES_AND_LINES
   TIFFTAG_BITSPERSAMPLE (TIFF) - BITS_PER_PIXEL
   TIFFTAG_PHOTOMETRIC (TIFF) - BAND_ORGANIZATION
   TIFFTAG_DATETIME (TIFF) - PRODUCTION_DATE
   TIFFTAG_IMAGEDESCRIPTION (TIFF) - QUADRANGLE_NAME and QUADRANT
   TIFFTAG_SAMPLESPERPIXEL (TIFF) - BAND_ORGANIZATION
   

   The .hdr files contain all of the DOQ 12/96 keyword header information
present.  They take the name of the original DOQ and add a .hdr to the end, 
ie, C2508038.NWS.hdr is the metadata file for C2508038.NWS.  Within that file, 
you will find an exact copy of the keyword header contained in the USGS DOQ.
