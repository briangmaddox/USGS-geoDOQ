# USGS-geoDOQ
Original DOQ to GeoTIFF production system.

This is part of a series of source that I either used, maintained, or wrote while at the USGS. It is the work of several government employees.  I'm putting it here as a sort of historical archive so that the various source repositories do not simply disappear. As they were developed by the government, they are all under the Public Domain.

This is not being done officially by the US Government, nor am I a representative of the US Government.  There are no warranties implied for this source.  There is also no support being offered for this repository.
